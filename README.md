# gnv-career-managers

Preemptively creating this repo. I think that the following tenets are important.

## Meritocracy

Mobiquity has honored us with the opportunity to be career managers. We are all equals in this regard, and we should value each others' opinions equally. We don't necessarily have to agree on everything, but we are all in the same position and we should feel free to present our own position to each other openly.

That being said, we are all different and may have different management styles and ideas. We don't necessarily have to conform to one style or process, and we need to be able to adapt to individual employees as well.

## Consistency

**Where it's important**. We want to make sure that every employee is treated equally and knows their rights and opportunities as an employee. This should transcend our individual management implementations.

We need to be aware of the *rules* and make sure that we can convey them to any Mobiquity employee. If someone from another team asks us about a *rule*, we should **all be able to give the same answer**.

If there is a discrepancy in what we believe to be a specific right of an employee, we need to address this with upper management.

## Transparency

I'll reiterate that we will have different management styles -- even wildly so. At the same time, we should *always* be aware **at all times** of what other managers are doing and know what options are available to all of us.

I propose we meet with some regularity to discuss what we're doing as managers.

If there is a conflict between management styles, we need to resolve this internally as a collective or escalate it to upper management.

## Accountability

As career managers, I want us to all be on the same team. If one career manager is in error, we should work to correct them. Trust is important, and I implicitly trust that you can handle your individual teams, but at the same time I want to know that every Mobiquity employee is getting the best experience we can provide for them.

We need to be able to readily challenge each other in cases where we have been wrong or have failed -- particularly when it impacts employees.

*If one of us fails, we all fail.*

We should be able to readily present ideas to each other before disseminating them to upper management / others. We can make sure that all of our initiatives succeed.

## Responsibility

I want each of us to be technical leaders in our role. No employee should look at us and question what we are doing. I want us to keep up with our individual platforms and make sure that we can readily participate in discussions with respect to those platforms. If an employee comes to us with questions, we should be able to either attempt an answer or incite discussion with the appropriate platform channel.

We have individual direct reports, but I also feel that we are responsible for any other Mobiquity employee -- to include each other. I cannot imagine a scenario where any career manager will be inadequate at handling an individual employee, but any of us should be able to readily handle this situation.

## Specificity

Big words and fancy ideas are great. What matters is what is tangible. We need to come up with *specific*, *tangible* initiatives to make sure we are progressing as a company and to make sure our employees are progressing as well. For examples, refer to [my team requirements](https://github.com/Team-Crites/welcome/blob/master/README.md#requirements) for examples of specificity -- I want particular participation based on numbers.

If there is an initiative, we need to make participation measurable. Let's not be accused of being managers who come up with ideas and don't follow through on them.

## Competition ... y

This is the **fun** section. I'd really like our teams to compete with each other in some way -- this is not necessarily possible cross-platform, but perhaps something like comparing amount of Stackoverflow rep earned per team would be good.

I'd like to encourage healthy competition to foster growth. My goal here is not to diminish anyone, so I think we have to be careful in this regard too. I'm very open to suggestions.

I also think that non-development competition and community is important too. We could all go to the lake and have a micro football tournament with GNV teams too. I'd like there to be some regular gathering of teams to engage in competition, discussion, participation -- all those nice things. I'd really like to work to foster a community at Mobiquity.

Doing this requires discipline and strict scheduling. There are already a lot of Mobiquity events that people are not aware of or do not participate in due to issues with scheduling, marketing, frequency, etc. I'd really like to improve participation and attendance for specific events.

I'd also like to participate in events that help the community -- hackathons, meetups, workshops, teaching, etc. It is *our responsibility* as career managers to make sure these opportunities are open to our employees.
